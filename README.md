# About me
This is a mock API with a few information on my favorite celebrity - Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas.
To mock an API is to do what the word " mock " does, to closely behave like an API.
During development, front-end developers who consume API are mostly ahead of the backend developers. 
In a scenario like this, using a mock API becomes beneficial.
